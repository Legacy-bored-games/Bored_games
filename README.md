# Bored Games
A web app that buddies you up with people near you who wish to play the same board games as you.

## Overview

### What the App does
The objective of this web app is to connect people who wish to play the same board games. Users can create an account, which will allow them to do the following:
- Search for board game sessions near them
- Book a seat in board game sessions they are interested in
- Host board game sessions that other users can book a seat in

### Technologies used
This web app utilises the MERN stack. MERN stands for:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) — document database
- [Express(.js)](https://expressjs.com/) — Node.js web framework
- [React(.js)](https://reactjs.org/) — a client-side JavaScript framework
- [Node(.js)](https://nodejs.org/en/) — the premier JavaScript web server

### Challenges
The main challenge we faced while developing this project was the limited amount of time provided, combined with our beginner-level knowledge which required that we spend more time on features that would otherwise be completed in a short amount of time. Some features remain to be completed and prefected, such as the embedded map feature.

### Future
This project is still ongoing. We plan to include the following features in the near future:
- Embedded map with a marker for each board game session that has been created by a user
- The ability to filter the results rendered on the map by applying a set of filters (location, preferred board game, number of players, average duration of play etc)
- The ability to update and/or cancel a board game session that has been created
